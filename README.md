# runnig workflows

## release


## push

following workflow runs push action when `git push` is executed and `tag` is set. Push is great 
when you need test or run linker but no simple release is possible because missing `upload_url` property in response.


```bash
on:
  push:
    # Sequence of patterns matched against refs/tags
    tags:
      - 'v*' # Push events to matching v*, i.e. v1.0, v20.15.10
